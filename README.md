## Exploratory Data Analysis
The project starts with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between different features. Key steps include:
- Loading and cleaning the data.
- Visualizing the distribution of sensor readings.
- Creating a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features.

## Model Building
The primary model used in this project is a neural network built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture consists of:
- An input layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.
- A hidden layer with 32 neurons and ReLU activation.
- An output layer with a single neuron and linear activation.

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R^2)

## Conclusion and Future Work
### Conclusion
- The deep learning model showed a reasonable performance in predicting the concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2(GT)).
- The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) indicates the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.
- The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) provides a measure of the differences between predicted and actual values.
- The R^2 score indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables.

### Future Work
- Incorporate more advanced models such as XGBoost or LightGBM.
- Collect more data to improve the robustness of the models.
- Apply the model to real-time data for continuous air quality monitoring.
- Explore feature engineering techniques to create new informative features.
- Conduct hyperparameter tuning to further optimize the model performance.
